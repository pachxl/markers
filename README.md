# Markers / Pings


![Close range marker](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/933456884965449832/937788149780873316/unknown.png)
- close range draws a blip sprite
- further than 100m draws a tall marker in the sky
- config
- marking a vehicle / ped will follow that entity (https://streamable.com/6nbkoj)


# Known Issues:
- Sometimes the marker just does not place, for example some mountains don't register not sure why
- Scaling on sprites / text might seem off it seemed fine when I tested
